# SmartHome
## Project description:
By utilizing sensors, actuators, motors, Single-board computers, and micro-controllers, we will
design and simulate a smart home. The smart home will capture environmental information and make a decision
based on received data. We will develop access control and occupancy systems and transfer all
data to the cloud or a local server. Finally, we will design and develop a web-based IoT dashboard to
control and monitor the system.
